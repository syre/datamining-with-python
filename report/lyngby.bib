                  learning-from-examples paradigm is the subject of
                  this review. Hints are the properties of the target
                  function that are known to us independently of the
                  training examples. The use of hints is tantamount to
                  combining rules and data in learning, and is
                  compatible with different learning models,
                  optimization techniques, and regularization
                  techniques. The hints are represented to the
                  learning process by virtual examples, and the
                  training examples of the target function are treated
                  on equal footing with the rest of the hints. A
                  balance is achieved between the information provided
                  by the different hints through the choice of
                  objective functions and learning schedules. The
                  Adaptive Minimization algorithm achieves this
                  balance by relating the performance on each hint to
                  the overall performance. The application of hints in
                  forecasting the very noisy foreign-exchange markets
                  is illustrated. On the theoretical side, the
                  information value of hints is contrasted to the
                  complexity value and related to the VC dimension.},

                  estimation, partial likelihood (PL) etimation
                  theory, which allows for (i) dependent obsevations,

                  information that is available at the time of
                  processing. For a general neural network conditional
                  distribution model we establish a fundamental
                  information-theoretic relationship for PL
                  estimation, and obtain large sample properties of PL
                  for the general case of dependent observations. We

                  testing hypotheses regarding activation in BOLD fMRI
                  data is critiqued on both theoretical and empirical
                  grounds. Theoretically, it is argued that the KS
                  test is formally unable to support inferences of
                  interest to most neuro-imaging studies and has
                  reduced sensitivity compared to parametric
                  alternatives. Empirically, false positive rates
                  yielded by the KS test in human data collected under
                  the null hypothesis were significantly in excess of
                  tabular values. These excessive false-positive rates
                  could be explained by the presence of temporal
                  autocorrelation within null-hypothesis fMRI data. We
                  also present evidence that the distribution of BOLD
                  fMRI data is only slightly non-normal, questioning
                  the initial impetus for the use of the KS test in
                  this context. Finally, it is noted that parametric
                  alternatives exist which do provide adequate control
                  of the false-positive rate and can support
                  inferences of interest.},

                  neural activity are delayed and dispersed in
                  time. The specific shape of these responses are of
                  some importance to the design and analysis of blood
                  oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional
                  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments. Using
                  fMRI scanning, we examine here the characteristics
                  and variability of hemodynamic responses from the
                  central sulcus in human subjects during an
                  event-related, simple reaction time
                  task. Specifically, we determine the contribution of
                  subject, day, and scanning session (within a day) to
                  variability in the shape of evoked hemodynamic
                  response. We find that while there is significant
                  and substantial variability in the shape of
                  responses collected across subjects, responses
                  collected during multiple scans within a single
                  subject are less variable. The results are discussed
                  in terms of the impact of response variability upon
                  sensitivity and specificity of analyses of
                  event-related fMRI designs.},

  abstract =     {When a parameter space has a certain underlying
                  structure, the ordinary  gradient of a function does
                  not represent its steepest direction, but the
                  natural gradient does. Information geometry is used
                  for calculating the natural gradients in the
                  parameter space of perceptrons, the space of
                  matrices (for blind source separation), and the
                  space of linear dynamical systems (for blind source
                  deconvolution). The dynamical behavior of natural
                  gradient online learning is analyzed and is proved
                  to be Fisher efficient, implying that it has
                  asymptotically the same performance as the optimal
                  batch estimation of parameters. This suggests that
                  the plateau phenomenon, which appears in the
                  backpropagation learning algorithm of multilayer
                  perceptrons, might disappear or might not be so
                  serious when the natural gradient is used. An
                  adaptive method of updating the learning rate is
                  proposed and analyzed},

  abstract =     {A method is suggested to ensure independence between
                  the estimated global flow and changes in local flow
                  in PET activation studies. Global flow is estimated
                  as the average of all intracerebral voxels, except
                  those that exhibit a consistent change in flow as a
                  consequence of the experimental design. This is
                  achieved by performing an initial analysis, using
                  all intracerebral voxels for estimation of global
                  flow, in which an F-map depicting task related
                  changes is produced. A second analysis is performed,
                  now excluding all voxels with a P < 0.05 in the
                  F-map when evaluating global flow, thereby ensuring
                  independence from areas changing in a task-dependent
                  manner. The feasibility of the method is
                  demonstrated on phantom data, showing that the
                  distribution is skewed in nonactivated areas when
                  including the activated areas in the calculation of
                  global flow. By excluding these areas the
                  distribution is translated toward zero and becomes
                  consistent with the null-hypothesis. Furthermore,
                  the usefulness of the suggested scheme is
                  demonstrated on human data. Scans performed while
                  subjects watched a movie featuring snakes were
                  contrasted to scans performed while watching white
                  noise, producing highly significant activations of
                  the visual system. When using the traditional way of
                  estimating global flow, deactivations were observed
                  in very large portions of the frontal, parietal, and
                  temporal lobes. When using the method suggested in
                  the present paper these disappeared, which would be
                  more consistent with the expected effects of the
                  stimulation. The method was used in conjunction with
                  both ratio and ANCOVA adjustment with very similar
                  results.},

                  in functional MRI (fMRI) data are presented. The
                  first test (t-test) is the optimal solution to the
                  problem of detecting a known activation signal in
                  Gaussian white noise. The results of this test are
                  shown to be equivalent to the cross-correlation
                  method that is widely used for activation detection
                  in fMRI. The second test (F test) is the optimal
                  solution when the measured data are modeled to
                  consist of an unknown activation signal that lies in
                  a known lower dimensional subspace of the
                  measurement space with added Gaussian white noise. A
                  model for the signal subspace based on a truncated
                  trigonometric Fourier series is proposed for
                  periodic activation-baseline imaging paradigms. The
                  advantage of the second method is that it does not
                  assume any information about the shape or delay of
                  the activation signal, except that it is periodic
                  with the same period as the activation-baseline
                  pattern. The two models are applied to experimental
                  echo-planar fMRI data sets and the results are
                  compared. },

                  in functional MRI (fMRI) data is presented. In this
                  method, the fMRI time series measured at each pixel
                  is modeled as the sum of a response signal which
                  arises due to the experimentally controlled
                  activation-baseline pattern, a nuisance component
                  representing effects of no interest, and Gaussian
                  white noise. For periodic activation-baseline
                  patterns, the response signal is modeled by a
                  truncated Fourier series with a known fundamental
                  frequency but unknown Fourier coefficients. The
                  nuisance subspace is assumed to be unknown. A
                  maximum likelihood estimate is derived for the
                  component of the nuisance subspace which is
                  orthogonal to the response signal subspace. An
                  estimate for the order of the nuisance subspace is
                  obtained from an information theoretic criterion. A
                  statistical test is derived and shown to be the
                  uniformly most powerful (UMP) test invariant to a
                  group of transformations which are natural to the
                  hypothesis testing problem. The maximal invariant
                  statistic used in this test has an F
                  distribution. The theoretical F distribution under
                  the null hypothesis strongly concurred with the
                  experimental frequency distribution obtained by
                  performing null experiments in which the subjects
                  did not perform any activation task. Application of
                  the theory to motor activation and visual
                  stimulation fMRI studies is presented. },

  abstract =     {This paper presents a method for the coregistration
                  and partitioning (i.e., tissue segmentation) of
                  brain images that have been acquired in different
                  modalities. The basic idea is that instead of
                  matching two images directly, one performs
                  intermediate within-modality registrations to two
                  template images that are already in register. One
                  can use a least-squares minimization to determine
                  the affine transformations that map between the
                  templates and the images. By incorporating suitable
                  constraints, a rigid body transformation which
                  directly maps between the images can be extracted
                  from these more general affine transformations. A
                  further refinement capitalizes on the implicit
                  normalization of both images into a standard
                  space. This facilitates segmentation or partitioning
                  of both original images into homologous tissue
                  classifications. Once partitioned, the partitions
                  can be jointly matched, further increasing the
                  accuracy of the coregistration. In short, these
                  techniques reduce the between-modality problem to a
                  series of simpler within-modality problems. These
                  methods are relatively robust, address a number of
                  problems in image transformations, and require no
                  manual intervention.},

                  well-established interrelation between physiological
                  function, energy metabolism, and localized blood
                  supply. A magnetic resonance technique was developed
                  for quantitative imaging of cerebral hemodynamics,
                  allowing for measurement of regional cerebral blood
                  volume during resting and activated cognitive
                  states. This technique was used to generate the
                  first functional magnetic resonance maps of human
                  task activation, by using a visual stimulus
                  paradigm. During photic stimulation, localized
                  increases in blood volume (32 +/- 10 percent, n = 7
                  subjects) were detected in the primary visual
                  cortex. Center-of-mass coordinates and linear
                  extents of brain activation within the plane of the

                  focal MRI signal changes in brain tissue that are
                  believed to result from changes in neuronal
                  activity. We describe the dependence of this
                  response in auditory cortex on the rate of
                  presentation of simple speech stimuli. Speech
                  syllables were presented to five normal subjects at
                  rates ranging from 0.17 to 2.5 Hz, while the
                  subjects performed a phoneme discrimination
                  task. Regions studied with FMRI during this task
                  included the lateral aspect of both temporal
                  lobes. All subjects showed bilateral superior
                  temporal lobe MRI signal increases that were
                  coincident with stimulus presentation and
                  performance of the task. The magnitude of this
                  response increased in a monotonic, non-linear manner
                  with increasing stimulus rate. This rate-response
                  relationship was nearly identical in right and left
                  hemispheres. The relationship may reflect metabolic
                  activity integrated over time and subject to
                  non-linear characteristics of neuronal recovery or
                  blood flow regulation. The dependence of response
                  magnitude on stimulation rate supports the
                  hypothesis that the FMRI phenomenon indirectly
                  reflects neuronal metabolic activity. The measures
                  provided here should assist in the design of optimal
                  activation strategies for the human auditory cortex.},

                  neural networks in many industrial applications has
                  been the difficulty of demonstrating that a trained
                  network will continue to generate reliable outputs
                  once it is in routine use. An important potential
                  source of errors is novel input data; that is, input
                  data which differ significantly from the data used
                  to train the network. The author investigates the
                  relationship between the degree of novelty of input
                  data and the corresponding reliability of the
                  outputs from the network. He describes a
                  quantitative procedure for assessing novelty, and
                  demonstrates its performance by using an application
                  which involves monitoring oil flow in multiphase

                  derivatives of the error function, is not bounded
                  below, and so can lead to difficulties if used
                  directly in a learning algorithm based on error
                  minimization. In this paper we show that for the
                  purposes of network training, the regularization term
                  can be reduced to a positive semi-definite form that
                  involves only first derivatives of the network
                  mapping. For a sum-of-squares error function, the
                  regularization term belongs to the class of
                  generalized Tikhonov regularizers. Direct
                  minimization of the regularized error function
                  provides a practical alternative to training with
                  noise.},

                  measures of regional cerebral counts, we
                  investigated the regional cortical activations
                  induced in eight normal subjects performing eight
                  different frequencies of fingertapping (0.5-4 Hz)
                  with the right index finger. The task was
                  auditorially cued and the performance recorded
                  during the scanning procedure. Performance
                  evaluation showed increased error rates, during
                  fingertapping, of high and low frequencies, and the
                  best tapping performance was measured in the
                  midrange of frequencies. Significantly activated
                  areas (p < 0.05) of normalized cerebral counts were
                  located in the left sensorimotor cortex (MISI),
                  right motor cortex, left thalamus, right insula,
                  supplementary motor area (SMA), and bilaterally in
                  the primary auditory cortex and the
                  cerebellum. Statistical evaluation showed a
                  significant (p < 0.01) and positive dependence of
                  cerebral activation upon movement rate in the
                  contralateral MISI. There was no significant rate
                  dependence of cerebral activation in other activated
                  motor areas. The SMA and the right cerebellar
                  hemisphere showed a more uniform activation
                  throughout the tapping frequency range. Furthermore,
                  we found a stimulus rate dependence of cerebral
                  activation in the primary auditory cortex. We
                  believe that the present data provide useful
                  information for the preparation and interpretation
                  of future motor activation studies of normal human
                  subjects and may serve as reference points for
                  studies of pathological conditions.},

  abstract =     {Visualization is essentially a collaborative
                  activity, widely used in many scientific and
                  engineering disciplines. Visualization may be used
                  to convey insight into phenomena that are
                  will-understood, or to present new data with a view
                  to finding new patterns of meaning and new
                  phenomena. Visualization is a powerful tool in
                  presentations (lectures, seminars, papers etc) and
                  in discussions between collegues. We are seeing a
                  growth in the use of video conferencing to
                  facilitate meetings between participants in
                  geographically separate locations, both specialized
                  facilities (video conference rooms) using dedicated
                  communications. channels (ISDN, ATM etc) and desktop
                  video conferencing using the Internet and multicast
                  (Mbone) communications. Distributed cooperative
                  visualization aims to enhance the video conferencing
                  environment (usually the desktop environment) with
                  access to visualization facilities. At the most
                  basic level, pre-generated visualizations may be
                  shared through a shared whiteboard tool. Richer
                  approaches enable users to share control of the kind
                  of visualization generated and the parameters used
                  in the generation. The World Wide Web provides a
                  basis for asyncronous cooperative working and there
                  are experimental extensions in the direction of
                  cooperative browsing. VRML provides the basis for
                  sharing 3D graphics over the Internet. We look at
                  ways in which VRML is being used in visualization,
                  to generate models which may be browsed by
                  participants in a session. Asyncronous collaboration
                  becomes possible by recording the details of the
                  visualization created by one participant, and making
                  this available to subsequent ``visitors'' to the Web
                  site. A multiuser audit trail emerges. Developments
                  on multi-user VRML worlds also have potential
                  applications in visualization, providing a form of
                  syncronous collaboration. This STAR reviews the state
                  of the art in these areas, draws out common threads
                  in these diverse approaches and looks at strengths,
                  weaknesses and opportunities for further development
                  in this field.}

  abstract =     {The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, as a
                  computer-intensive statistical tool, has enjoyed
                  enormous upsurge in interest over the last few
                  years. This paper provides a simple, comprehensive
                  and tutorial review of some of the most common areas
                  of research in this field. We begin by discussing
                  how MCMC algorithms can be constructed from standard
                  building-clocks to produce Markov chains with the
                  desired stationary distribution. We also motivate
                  and discuss more complex ideas that have been
                  proposed in the literature, such as continuous time
                  and dimension jumping methods. We discuss some
                  implementational issues associated with MCMC
                  methods. We take a look at the arguments for and
                  against multiple replications, consider how long
                  chains should be run for and how to determine
                  suitable starting points. We also take a look at
                  graphical models and how graphical approaches can be
                  used to simplify MCMC implementation. Finally, we
                  present a couple of examples, which we use as
                  case-studies to highlight some of the points made
                  earlier in the text. In particular, we use a simple
                  changepoint model to illustate how to tackle a
                  typical Bayesian modelling problem via the MCMC
                  method, before using mixture model probles to
                  provide illustrations of good sampler output and of
                  the implementation of a reversible jump MCMC algorithm.},

                  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired
                  during periodic sensory stimulation are: i) how to
                  measure the experimentally determined effect in fMRI
                  time series; and ii) how to decide whether an
                  apparent effect is significant. Our approach is
                  first to fit a time series regression model,
                  including sine and cosine terms at the
                  (fundamental) frequency of experimental stimulation,
                  by pseudogeneralized least squares (PGLS) at each
                  pixel of an image. Sinusoidal modeling takes account
                  of locally variable hemodynamic delay and
                  dispersion, and PGLS fitting corrects for residual
                  or endogennous autocorrelation in fMRI time series,
                  to yield best unbiased estimates of the amplitudes
                  of the sine and consine terms at fundamental
                  frequency; from these parameters the authors derive
                  estimates of experimentally determined power and its
                  standard error. Randomization testing is then used
                  to create inferential brain avtivation maps (BAMs)
                  of pixels significantly activated by the
                  experimental stimulus The methods are illustrated by
                  application to data acquired from normal human
                  subjects during periodic visual and auditory
                  stimulation.},

  abstract =     {The central decision in ecery functional magnetic
                  resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment is whether
                  pixels in brain tissues are showing activation in
                  respones to neural stimulus or as a result of
                  noise. Images are degraded not only by random (e.g.,
                   thermal) noise, but also by structure noise due to
                  MR system characteristics, cardiac and respiratory
                  pulsation, and patient motion. A novel digital
                  filter has been developed to suppress cardiac  and
                  respiratory structured noise in fMRI images, using
                  estimates of structured and random noise power
                  spectra obtained directly from the images. It is an
                  adaptive filter based on stationary noise
                  statistics, and is equivalent in form to a Wiener
                  filter. A mathematical model of the filtering
                  process was developed to understand how the strength
                  and destribution of structured and random noise
                  poxer influenced filter performance. The filter was
                  tested using images from an auditory activation
                  study of ten subjects. In subjects whose structured
                  noise power was  localized to a relatively narrow
                  frequency range, a strong  relationship was found,
                  both experimentally ($R = 0.975, P < 0.0004$ for
                  $H_0: R = 0$) and using the model, between filter
                  performance and the level of structured noise power
                  contaminating the experiment frequency. The filter
                  significantly reduced the rate of false-positive
                  activations in the subset of subjects whose
                  experment frequency was relatively heavily
                  contaminated by structured noised. Notch filters,
                  that simply eliminate unwanted frequencies,
                  performed poorly in all subjects. Unlike the
                  proposed Winer filter, these filters did not
                  suppress structured noise power at the experiment
                  frequency that contributes to false-positive
                  activations.},

  abstract =     {When describing and displaying inter-group
                  relationships using canonical variate analysis, the
                  question often arises: which variables contribute
                  most to the group separation along particular
                  canonical vectors? This proble is discussed in the
                  context of an example which uses remotely sensed
                  data to discriminate between cover classes. The
                  appropriate between-groups matrix to be input into
                  subset selection procedures is identified. When
                  combined with subsequent simplification of the
                  vectors, the approach leads to a simpler
                  interpretion of the canonical variate display.},

                  clusters. Most of the clusters are easily
                  identified as subdisciplinary subject areas. The
                  data source was the cross citing amongst the
                  journals derived from the Journal Citation Index
                  (JCI), a file derived in turn from the Science
                  Citation Index (SCI). The JCI consists of journal
                  by journal tabulation of citings to and from each
                  journal processed in the SCI. Two-step citation maps
                  linking the clusters are presented for each
                  discipline. Within the disciplines the clusters of
                  journals form fully transitive hierarchies with very

                  parsing and then consider part-of-speech tagging,
                  which was the first syntactic problem to be
                  successfully attacked by statistical techniques and
                  also serves as a good warmup for the main topic,
                  statistical parsing. Here we consider both the
                  simplified case in which the input string is viewed
                  as a string of parts of speech, and the more
                  interesting case in which the parser is guided by
                  statistical information about the particular words
                  in the sentence. Finally we anticipate future
                  research directions.},

                  Jelinek and Mercer (1980), Katz (1987), and Church
                  and Gale (1991). We investigate for the first time
                  how factors such as training data size, corpus
                  (e.g., Brown versus Wall Street Journal), and n-gram
                  order (bigram versus trigram) affect the relative
                  performance of these methods, which we measure
                  through the cross-entropy of test data. In addition,
                  we introduce two novel smoothing techniques, one a
                  variation of Jelinek-Mercer smoothing and one a very
                  simple linear interpolation technique, both of which

                  chain method to simulate multivariate
                  distributions. A simple, intuitive derivation of
                  this method is given along with guidance on
                  implementation. Also discussed are two applications
                  of the algorithm, one for implementing
                  acceptance-rejection sampling when a blanketing
                  function is not available and the other for
                  implemention the algorithm with block-at-a-time
                  scans. In the latter situation, many different
                  algorithms, including the Gibbs sampler, are shown
                  to be special cases of the Metropolis-Hastings

                  (r.v.) that are symmetric nondecreasing functionals
                  of the canonical coefficients provided by the
                  nonlinear canonical analysis of the r.v.'s are
                  studied. These measures can be used to characterize
                  independence. Their estimators are obtained by
                  stimating a suitable approximation to nonlinear
                  canonical analysis. When some conditions are
                  satisfied, asymptotic distributions of the
                  estimators, both under the independece hypothesis
                  and under dependence, are given. A class of tests of
                  independence with asymptotic level of significance
                  can be investigated.},

                  implicit higher-order structure in the association
                  of terms with documents (``semantic structure'') in
                  order to improve the detection of relevant documents
                  on the basis of terms found in queries. The
                  particular technique used is singular-value
                  decomposition, in which a large term by document
                  matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100
                  orthogonal factors from which the original matrix
                  can be approximated by linear combination. Documents
                  are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor
                  weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document
                  vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms,
                  and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are
                  returned. Initial tests find this completely
                  automatic method for retrieval to be promising.},

  abstract =     {The selection of the number of past observations to
                  be included in a linear predictor (the order of the
                  predictor) should be done with minimum variability,
                  since it is not taken into account in the inference
                  stage. For finite time series, there is a trade-off
                  between variability and optimality (in the sense of
                  mean squared prediction error). The widely used
                  Akaike criteria, FPE and AIC, lead to highly
                  variable estimated orders, whereas consistent
                  criteria are downward biased when the optimal order
                  increases with the sample size. In this paper we
                  propose the use of a sequence of tests to analyse
                  the order selected with FPE. The result is a new
                  identification criterion. In a simulation study,
                  this criterion is shown to reach a compromize with
                  respect to the above-mentioned trade-off. Some
                  asymptotic properties are also derived.},

  abstract =     {In this paper we provide theoretical foundations for
                  a new neural model for singular value decomposition
                  based on an extension of the Hebbian learning rule
                  called the cross-coupled Hebbian rule. The model is
                  extracting the SVD of the cross-correlation matrix
                  of two stochastic signals and is an extension on
                  previous work on neural-network-related principal
                  component analysis (PCA). We prove the asymptotic
                  convergence of the network to the principal
                  (normalized) singular vectors of the
                  cross-correlation and we provide simulation results
                  which suggest taht the convergence is
                  exponential. The new model may have useful
                  applications in the problems of filtering for signal
                  processing and signal detectinon.},

                  usually leads to intractable calculations, since the

                  partitions of the sample. We present approximation
                  methods which evaluate the posterior distribution
                  and Bayes estimators by Gibbs sampling, relying on
                  the missing data structure of the mixture model. The
                  {\em data augmentation} method is shown to converge
                  geometrically, since a duality principle transfers
                  properties from the discrete missing data chain to
                  the parameters. The fully conditional Gibbs
                  alternative is shown to be ergodic and geometric
                  convergence is established n the normal case. We
                  also consider non-informative approximations
                  associated with improper priors, assuming that the

                  technology improvements and other factors. They

                  on their applications for industrial and other
                  purposes. Many of the display types described have

                  regions activated by periodic experimental design in
                  functional magnetic resonance imaging data. This
                  involves fitting a mixture distribution with two
                  components to a test statistic estimated at each
                  voxel in an image. The two parameters of this
                  distribution, the proportion of nonactivated voxels,
                  and the effect size can be estimated using maximum
                  likelihood methods. Standard errors of the
                  parameters can also be estimated. The fitted
                  distribution can be used to derive brain activation
                  maps and two examples are described, one involving a
                  visual stimulation task, the other an auditory
                  stimulation task. The method appears to have some
                  advantages over direct use of the P-values
                  corresponding to each voxel's value of the test

                  supervised learning algorithm for artificial neural
                  networks. Instead of just adjusting the weights in a
                  network of fixed topology, Cascade-Correlation
                  begins with a minimal network, then automatically
                  trains and adds new hidden units one by one, creating
                  a multi-layer structure. Once a new hidden unit has
                  been added to the network, its input-side weights
                  are frozen. This unit then becomes a permanent
                  feature-detector in the network, available for
                  producing outputs or for creating other, more
                  complex feature detectors. The Cascade-Correlation
                  architecture has several advantages over existing
                  algorithms: it learns very quickly, the network
                  determines its own size and topology, it retains the
                  structures it has built even if the training set
                  changes, and it requires no back-probagation of
                  error signals through the connections of the
                  network.},

                  suggested to use a quasi maximum likelihood approach
                  rather than the standard sum of squared errors, thus
                  taking dependencies among the errors ot the
                  individual time series into account. This may lead
                  to improved generalization performance. Further, we
                  extend the Optimal Brain Damage pruning technique to
                  the multi-variate case. A key ingredient is an
                  algebraic expression for the generalization ability
                  of a multi-variate mode. The variability of the
                  suggested techniques are succesfully demonstrated in a
                  multi-variate scenario involving the prediction of
                  the cylinder pressure in a marine engine.},

                  among group-mean studies, these being the most
                  prevalent type of study in the functional imaging
                  literature. The FVM modeling strategy is tested by:
                  (1) constructing an FVM of the mouth region of
                  primary motor cortex using published, group-mean,
                  functional imaging reports as input, and (2)
                  comparing the confidence bounds predicted by that
                  FVM with those observed in 10 normal subjects
                  performing overt-speech tasks. The FVM model
                  correctly predicted the mean location and spatial
                  distribution of per-subject functional
                  responses. FVM has a wide range of applications,
                  including hypothesis testing for statistical
                  parametric images. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

                  mental operations. This process is iterative, as no
                  single study can fully characterize a mental
                  operation or its brain location. This iterative
                  discovery process, in combination with the
                  location-reporting standard (i.e. spatial
                  coordinates) of the cognitive neuroimaging
                  community, has engendered a new form of
                  metanalysis. Response locations from multiple
                  studies have been analyzed collectively so as to
                  better describe the spatial distribution of brain
                  activations, with promising results. New hypotheses
                  regarding elementary mental operations and their
                  respective brain locations are being generated and
                  refined via metanalysis. These hypotheses are being
                  tested and confirmed by subsequent, prospective
                  experiments. Function/location metanalysis is an
                  important new tool for hypothesis generation in
                  cognitive neuroimaging. This form of metanalysis is
                  fundamentally different from the effect-size
                  metanalyses prevalent in other literatures, with
                  unique advantages and challenges.},

                  construct for metanalytic modeling of the locations
                  of brain functional areas as spatial probability
                  distributions. FV models have a variety of
                  applications, in particular, to serve as spatially
                  explicit predictions of the Talairach-space
                  locations of functional activations, thereby
                  allowing voxel-based analyses to be hypothesis
                  testing rather than hypothesis generating. As image
                  averaging is often applied in the analysis of
                  functional images, an important feature of FVM is
                  that a model can be scaled to accommodate any degree
                  of intersubject image averaging in the data set to
                  which the model is applied. In this report, the
                  group-size scaling properties of FVM were
                  tested. This was done by: (1) scaling a previously
                  constructed FV model of the mouth representation of
                  primary motor cortex (M1-mouth) to accommodate
                  various degrees of averaging (number of subjects per
                  image = n = 1, 2, 5, 10), and (2) comparing
                  FVM-predicted spatial probability contours to
                  location-distributions observed in averaged images
                  of varying n composed from randomly sampling a
                  30-subject validation data set.},

  abstract =     {Statistical parametric maps (SPMs) are potentially
                  powerful ways of localizing differences in regional
                  cerebral activity. This potential is limited by
                  uncertainties in assessing the significance of these
                  maps. In this report, we describe an approach that
                  may partially resolve this issue. A distinction is
                  made between using SPMs as images of change
                  significance and using them to identify foci of
                  significant change. In the first case, the SPM can
                  be reported nonselectively as a single mathematical
                  object with its omnibus significance. Alternatively,
                  the SPM constitutes a large number of repeated
                  measures over the brain. To reject the null
                  hypothesis, that no change has occurred at a
                  specific location, a threshold adjustment must be
                  made that accounts for the large number of
                  comparisons made. This adjustment is shown to depend
                  on the SPM's smoothness. Smoothness can be
                  determined empirically and be used to calculate a
                  threshold required to identify significant foci. The
                  approach models the SPM as a stationary stochastic
                  process. The theory and applications are illustrated
                  using uniform phantom images and data from a verbal
                  fluency activation study of four normal subjects.},

                  testing for correlations, between sensory input and
                  the hemodynamic response, after convolving the
                  sensory input with an estimate of the hemodynamic

                  To lend the approach statistical validity, it is

                  mapping by using a measure of cross-correlations,

                  non-linear spatial (stereotactic) normalisation and

                  explicitly, using a least squares solution and a

                  system which indexes academic literature in
                  electronic format (e.g. Postscript files on the
                  Web). CiteSeer understands how to parse citations,
                  identify citations to the same paper in different
                  formats, and identify the context of citations in
                  the body of articles. CiteSeer provides most of the
                  advantages of traditional (manually constructed)
                  citation indexes (e.g. the ISI citation indexes),
                  including: literature retrieval by following
                  citation links (e.g. by providing a list of papers
                  that cite a given paper), the evaluation and ranking
                  of papers, authors, journals, etc. based on the
                  number of citations, and the identification of
                  research trends. CiteSeer has many advantages over
                  traditional citation indexes, including the ability
                  to create more up-to-date databases which are not
                  limited to a preselected set of journals or
                  restricted by journal publication delays, completely
                  autonomous operation with a corresponding reduction
                  in cost, and powerful interactive browsing of the
                  literature using the context of citations. Given a
                  particular paper of interest, CiteSeer can display
                  the context of how the paper is cited in subsequent
                  publications. This context may contain a brief
                  summary of the paper, another author's response to
                  the paper, or subsequent work which builds upon the
                  original article. CiteSeer allows the location of
                  papers by keyword search or by citation
                  links. Papers related to a given paper can be
                  located using common citation information or word
                  vector similarity. CiteSeer will soon be available
                  for public use.},

                  statistical methods offered, and output choices. The

                  extracting one or more parameters for the individual
                  voxels. Methods based, e.g., on various statistical
                  tests are then used to yield parameters
                  corresponding to probability of activation or
                  activation strength. However, these methods do not
                  indicate whether sets of voxels are activated in a
                  similar way or in different ways. Typically, delays
                  between two activated signals are not identified. In
                  this article, we use clustering methods to detect
                  similarities in activation between voxels. We employ
                  a novel metric that measures the similarity between
                  the activation stimulus and the fMRI signal. We
                  present two different clustering algorithms and use
                  them to identify regions of similar activations in
                  an fMRI experiment involving a visual stimulus.},

                  equivalence between adaptive ridge and lasso (least
                  absolute shrinkage and selection operator). This
                  equivalence states that both procedures produce the

                  viewed as a particular quadratic penalization.

                  From this observation, we derive an EM algiorithm to
                  compute the lasso solution. We finally present a

  abstract =     {There are now methods for organising a Markov chain
                  Monte Carlo simulation so that it can be guaranteed
                  that the state of the process at a given time is
                  exactly drawn from the target distribution. The
                  question of assessing convergence totally
                  vanishes. Such methods are known as exact or perfect
                  sampling. The approach that has received most
                  attention uses the protocol of coupling from the
                  past devised by Propp and Wilson (Random Structures
                  and Algorithms,1996), in which multiple dependent
                  paths of the chain are run from different initial
                  states at a sequence of initial times going
                  backwards into the past, until they satisfy the
                  condition of coalescence by time 0. When this is
                  achieved the state at time 0 is distributed
                  according to the required target. This process must
                  be implemented very carefully to assure its validity
                  (including appropriate re-use of random number
                  streams), and also requires one of various tricks to
                  enable us to follow infinitely many sample paths
                  with a finite amount of work. 

                  With the ultimate objective of Bayesian MCMC with
                  guaranteed convergence, the purpose of this paper is
                  to describe recent efforts to construct exact
                  sampling methods for continuous-state Markov
                  chains. We review existing methods based on
                  gamma-coupling and rejection sampling (Murdoch and
                  Green, Scandinavian Journal of Statistics, 1998),
                  that are quite straightforward to understand, but
                  require a closed form for the transition kernel and
                  entail cumbersome algebraic manipulation. We then
                  introduce two new methods based on random walk
                  Metropolis, that offer the prospect of more
                  automatic use, not least because the difficult,
                  continuous, part of the transition mechanism can be
                  coupled in a generic way, using a proposal
                  distribution of convenience. 

                  One of the methods is based on a neat decomposition
                  of any unimodal (multivariate) symmetric density
                  into pieces that may be re-assembled to construct
                  any translated copy of itself: that allows coupling
                  of a continuum of Metropolis proposals to a finite
                  set, at least for a compact state space. We discuss
                  methods for economically coupling the subsequent
                  accept/reject decisions. 

                  Our second new method deals with unbounded state
                  spaces, using a trick due to W. S. Kendall of
                  running a coupled dominating process in parallel
                  with the sample paths of interest. The random subset
                  of the state space below the dominating path is
                  compact, allowing efficient coupling and
                  coalescence. 

                  We look towards the possibility that application of
                  such methods could become sufficiently convenient
                  that they could become the basis for routine
                  Bayesian computation in the foreseeable future.},

                  nonzero population correlation coefficients is
                  called the dimensionality. Asymptotic distributions
                  of the dimensionalities estimated by Mallows's
                  criterion and Akaike's criterion are given for
                  nonnormal multivariate populations with finite
                  fourth moments. These distributions have a simple
                  form in the case of elliptical populations, and
                  modified criteria are proposed which adjust for
                  nonzero kurtosis. An estimation method based on a
                  marginal likelihood function for the dimensionality
                  is introduced and the asymptotic distribution of the
                  corresponding estimator is derived for multivariate
                  normal populations. It is shown that this estimator
                  is not consistent, but that a simple modification
                  yields consistency. An overall comparison of the
                  various estimation methods is conducted through
                  simulation studies},

  abstract =     {The purpose of this work was to investigate the
                  validity of perfusion MRI in comparison with stable
                  xenon CT for evaluating regional cerebral blood flow
                  (rCBF). The rCBF was measured by xenon CT and
                  perfusion MRI within a 24 h interval in 10 patients
                  (mean+or-SD age 63+or-10 years). For perfusion MRI,
                  absolute values of rCBF were calculated based on the
                  indicator dilution theory after injection of 0.1
                  mmol/kg of Gd-DTPA. Eight to 10 regions of interest
                  (37 mm/sup 2/) were located in the white and gray
                  matter on the rCBF images for each of the 10
                  patients. The mean+or-SD values of rCBF in gray
                  matter were 48.5+or-14.1 ml/100 g/min measured by
                  xenon CT and 52.2+or-16.4 ml/100 g/min measured by
                  perfusion MRI. In the white matter, the rCBF was
                  22.6+or-9.1 ml/100 g/min by xenon CT and 27.4+or-6.8
                  ml/100g/min by perfusion MRI. There was a good
                  correlation of rCBF values between perfusion MRI and
                  xenon CT (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.83;
                  p<0.0001). It is concluded that, comparable to xenon
                  CT, perfusion MRI provides relatively high
                  resolution, quantitative local rCBF information
                  coupled to MR anatomy},

                  against the Library of Congress category system,
                  then comparing them with the number of published
                  books within the categories. This method shows that,
                  e.g., the literature category is underrepresented in
                  Wikipedia, explained by the lack of fiction in
                  Wikipedia. Other categories underrepresented are,
                  e.g., medicine, philosophy and law, whereas science
                  and some areas with systematice mass-inserted
                  articles, such as naval and geography, are well
                  represented. Also fans tend to add, e.g., popular
                  music groups and literature description
                  articles. The length of medicine and law article are
                  large compared to the rest of the articles. The

                  specialized encyclopedia in physics, linguistic and

  abstract =     {We investigate the error versus reject tradeoff for
                  classifiers. Our analysis is motivated by the
                  remarkable similarity in error-reject tradeoff
                  curves for widely differing algorithms classifying
                  handwritten characters. We present the data in a new
                  scaled version that makes this universal character
                  particularly evident. Based on Chow's theory of the
                  error-reject tradeoff and its underlying Bayesian
                  analysis we argue that such universality is in fact
                  to be expected for general classification
                  problems. Furthermore, we extend Chow's theory to
                  classifiers working from finite samples on a broad,
                  albeit limited, class of problems. The prolems we
                  consider are {\em effectively binary}, i.e.,
                  classification problems for which almost all inputs
                  invove a choice between the right classification and
                  at most one predominant alternative. We show that
                  for such problems at most half of the initially
                  rejected inputs would have been errorneously
                  classified. we show further that such problems arise
                  naturally as small perturbations ot the PAC model
                  for large training sets. The perturbed model leads
                  us to conclude that the dominant source of error
                  comes from pairwise overlapping categories. For
                  infite training sets, the overlap is due to noise
                  and/or poor preprocessing. For finite training sets
                  there is an additional contribution from the
                  inevitable displacement of the decision boundaries
                  due to diniteness of the sample. In either case, a
                  rejection mechanism which rejects inputs in a shell
                  surrounding the decision boundaries leads to a
                  universal form for the error-reject
                  tradeoff. Finally we analyze a specific reject
                  mechanism based on the extent of consensus among an
                  ensemble of classifiers. For the ensemble reject
                  mechanism we find an analytic expression for the
                  error-reject tradeoff based on a maximum entropy
                  estimate of the problem difficulty distribution.},

                  is computationally expensive due to replicated
                  training sessions. In this paper we suggest linear
                  unlearning of examples as an approach to
                  approximative croos-validation. Further, we discuss
                  the possibility of exploiting the ensemble of
                  networks offered by leave-one-out for performing
                  ensemble predictions and for obtaining error bars on
                  future examples. We show that 1) the optimal
                  ensemble prediction, based on linear combinations of
                  the individual networks, is obtained by weighting
                  the networks equally, and 2) that the generalization
                  performance of the ensemble predictor is identical
                  to that of the network trained on the whole training
                  set.

                  popular data-analytic tool for studying the
                  relationship between a set of predictors and a
                  categorical response. In this paper we describe a
                  penalized version of LDA. It is designed for
                  situations in which there are many highly correlated
                  predictors, such as those obtained by discretizing a
                  functio, or the grey-scale values of the pixels in a
                  series of images. In cases such as these it is
                  natural, efficient and sometimes essential to impose
                  a spatial smopthness constraint on the
                  coefficients, both for improved prediction
                  performance and interpretability. We cast the
                  classification problem into a regression framework
                  via optimal scoring. Using this, our proposal
                  facilitates the use of any penalized regression
                  technique in the classification setting. The
                  technique is illustrated  with examples in speech

                  assuming Gaussian distributions for each class. In
                  this paper, we fit Gaussian mixtures to each class
                  to facilitate effective classification in non-normal
                  settings, especially when the classes are
                  clustered. Low dimensional views are an important
                  by-product of LDA - our new techniques inherit this
                  feature. We can control the within-class spread of
                  the subclass centres relative to the between-class
                  spread. Our technique for fitting these models
                  permits a natural blend with nonparametric versions

  abstract =     {To assess the effect of various analysis parameters
                  on the sensitivity of event-related fMRI analyses,
                  36 analyses were performed on a single fMRI
                  data-set, varying parameters along four axes: (1)
                  resampled voxel size; (2) spatial smoothing; (3)
                  temporal smoothing; and (4) the set of basis
                  functions used to model event-related
                  responses. Sensitivity (i.e., the probability of
                  detecting an activation given it exists) was
                  assessed in terms of Z scores and by a metric for
                  corrected P values, the negative log of the expected
                  Euler characteristic. Sixteen brain regions
                  distributed across cortical and subcortical areas
                  were included in the meta-analysis. Main effects on
                  sensitivity were found for resampled voxel size,
                  spatial smoothing, temporal smoothing, and the set
                  of basis functions chosen. The analysis parameters
                  that generally produced the most sensitive analyses
                  were a 2-mm(3) resampled voxel size, 10-mm spatial
                  smoothing, 4-s temporal smoothing, and a basis set
                  comprising a hemodynamic response function and its
                  temporal derivative. Copyright 2000 Academic

                  (PET), measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF)
                  as an index of neuronal activity, to investigate the
                  central processing of itch in 10 healthy volunteers
                  subjected to intracutaneous injections of
                  histamine. 

                  2. The study has unraveled a central reprensentation
                  that depicts a motor intention of the urge to
                  scratch contigent on the perception of unpleasant
                  itch. The coactivation of the anterior congulate
                  cortex (ACC), supplementary motor area (SMA),
                  premotor area (PM), and inferior parietal lobule

                  ACC (Brodmann 24) is related to the
                  sensorial/affectional aspect of the event. The

                  positron emission tomography (PET) suggest a
                  preference of the right hemisphere, especially the
                  anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), in affective
                  processing of the clinical pain syndromes. We have
                  investigated the central processing of cluster
                  headache (CH) attacks provoked by sublingual
                  nitroglycerin (NTG). In the cerebrum, provoked CH
                  activated the ACC and the temporopolar region of the
                  right hemisphere in addition to other regions. The
                  regions activated in the ACC (Brodmann area (BA) 24
                  and 32) are involved in affective/cognitive
                  processing of pain and willed attention. Our study
                  discloses the preferential role of the right
                  hemisphere in attributing emotional valence and
                  attention to the suffering of pain. The findings
                  support the theory of a right hemispheric
                  specialisation in the mediation of
                  withdrawal-related negative affect. The divergence
                  of the distributed central processing between
                  provoked cluster headache attack and experimentally
                  induced acute pain indicates different central
                  mechanisms for different types of pain},

                  assessment of neurological patients is increasingly
                  important. Here, we review data mainly from emission
                  tomography techniques, namely positron emission
                  tomography (PET) and single photon emission
                  computerized tomography (SPECT), that have helped
                  elucidate the pathophysiology of a number of
                  neurological diseases and have suggested strategies
                  in the treatment of neurological patients. We also
                  suggest possible future developments of functional
                  neuroimaging applied to clinical populations and
                  briefly touch on the emerging role of functional
                  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in clinical

  abstract =     {Regional cerebral blood flow was measured in six
                  healthy volunteers by positron emission tomography
                  during identification of speaker and emotion from
                  spoken words. The speaker identification task
                  activated several audio-visual multimodal areas,
                  particularly the temporal poles in both hemispheres,
                  which may be involved in connecting vocal attributes
                  with the visual representations of speakers. The
                  emotion identification task activated regions in the
                  cerebellum and the frontal lobe, suggesting a
                  functional relationship between those regions
                  involved in emotion. The results suggest that
                  different anatomical structures contribute to the
                  vocal identification of speaker and emotion.},

                  use of established statistical techniques that
                  correct for multiple comparisons in the context of
                  spatially smooth and serially correlated
                  data. Responses are modelled using event-related
                  temporal basis functions. Inferences are then made
                  about all components of the model, using the F-ratio
                  at all voxels in the image, to produce a statistical
                  parametric map (SPM{F}). This method allows for the
                  experimental design to relate the timing of events
                  to the acquisition of data to give a temporal
                  resolution (with respect to the event-related
                  response) far better than the scanning repeat
                  time.},

                  widely used for the design of digital FIR
                  filters. In the conventional WLS, the filter
                  coefficients are obtained by performing a matrix
                  inverse operation, which needs computation of
                  $O(N^3)$. The authors present a new WLS algorithm
                  that introduces an extra frequency response
                  including implicitly the weight function. In the new
                  algorithm, the filter coefficientcan be solved just
                  by a matrix vector multiplication. It reduces the
                  computational complexity from $O(N^3)$ to
                  $O(N^2)$.},

                  did not change on the frontal surface. The increase

                  deoxyhemoglobin, suggesting cerebral vascular
                  dilatation with decreased oxygen consumption. After

                  may be divided into two groups termed primary inputs
                  and contextual inputs. The goal of the network is to
                  discover those linear functions of the primary
                  inputs that are maximally related to the information
                  contained in the contextual units. The strength of
                  relationship between the two sets of inputs is
                  measured using their average mutual information; in
                  the situation where the inputs follow a
                  multivariate, elliptically-symmetic probability
                  model, this is equivalent to performing a cnonical
                  correlation analysis. We introduce a stochastic
                  algorithm to achieve this and present some
                  theoretical details including a convergence
                  result. Some possible nonlinear extensions are
                  mentioned briefly.},

                  information in MR images. Several coregistration
                  algorithms have been published and are used in
                  functional brain imaging studies. In this paper, we
                  present a comparison and cross validation of the two
                  most widely used coregistration routines (Friston et
                  al., 1995, Hum. Brain Map. 2: 165-189; Woods et al.,
                  1993, J. Comput. Assisted Tomogr. 17:
                  536-546). Several transformationswere applied to
                  high-resolution anatomical MR images to generate
                  simulated PET images so that the exact (rigid body)
                  transformations between each MR image and its
                  associated simulated PET imageswere known. The
                  estimation error of a coregistration in relation to
                  the known transformation allows a comparison of the
                  performance of different coregistration
                  routines. Under the assumption that the simulated PET
                  images embody the salient features of real PET
                  images with respect to coregistration,this study
                  shows that the routines examined reliably solve the

                  classification stage. We denote this method as a
                  {\em hierarchical seqeuntial pruning classification
                  (HISPruC)} Strategy. The backbone of this algorithm
                  is a recursive application of feature ranking and
                  designing a classifier that matches the underlying
                  good feature distribution derived from the {\em

                  tokens that fall into easily separable regions. We

                  independent component analysis (ICA) for dimensional
                  reduction and representation of word histograms. The
                  analysis is carried out in a likelihood framework
                  which allows estimates of the loadings (source
                  signals), the mixing matrix and the noise level. In
                  the face of noisy signals, the estimated sources are
                  non-linear functionals of the observed signals, in
                  contrast to the linear noise free case. We also
                  discuss the generalizability of the estimated models
                  and show that an empirical test error estimate may
                  be used to optimize model dimensionality, in
                  particular the optimal number of sources. When
                  applied to word histograms ICA is shown to produce
                  representations that are better aligned with the
                  group structure in the text data than the LSA.},

  abstract =     {When studying complex cognitive tasks using
                  functional magnetic resonance (fMR) imaging one
                  often encounters weak signal responses. These weak
                  responses are corrupted by noise and artifacts of
                  various sources. Preprocessing of the raw data
                  before the application of test statistics helps to
                  extract the signal and thus can vastly improve
                  signal detection. The authors discuss artifact
                  sources and algorithms to handle them. Experiments
                  with simulated and real data underline the
                  usefulness of this preprocessing sequence},

                  rediscovering and adapting established statistical
                  methods for its use, including design of
                  experiments, the general linear model, contrasts,
                  random field theory, longitudinal models, Fourier
                  analysis, and general signal and image processing
                  methods. This brief paper gives an example of
                  comparative performance of five different
                  statistical models applied to the same set of data
                  generated in an fMRI study of motor cortex. These
                  methods include a two-sample t-statistic, a
                  Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, a principal
                  component/canonical variates approach, a pruned
                  feed-forward artificial neural network with one
                  hidden layer, and a frequency domain regression
                  convolution model allowing for spatially varying
                  hemodynamic responses. Produced by essentially
                  empirical statistical models, there appear to be
                  more similarities than differences in these spatial
                  activation patterns, yet all lack explicit
                  incorporation of substantive prior
                  information. Distinctions are drawn between
                  exploratory models for hypothesis generation and
                  confirmatory models for hypothesis testing. In
                  addition, the Bayesian paradigm helps to combine
                  empirical and substantive models, and meta-analysis
                  provides a rational means by which to combine
                  information over a range of similar results affected
                  minimally by publication bias.},

                  of neural network modeling. The optimal architecture
                  is defined as the one which minimizes the
                  generalization error. This paper addresses
                  estimation of the generalization performance of
                  regularized, complete neural network
                  models. Regularization normally improves the
                  generalization performance by restricting the model
                  complexity. A formula for the optimal weight decay
                  regularizer is derived. A regularized model may be
                  characterized by an effective number of weights
                  (parameters); however, it is demonstrated that no
                  simple definition is possible. A novel estimator of
                  the average generalization error (called \em{FPER})

                  product form systems, e.g. the multiservice loss
                  system. First, two methods for generating the
                  samples are discussed, the traditional Monte Carlo
                  and the so called Gibbs sampler. Then a variance
                  reduction method, the conditional expectation
                  method, is presented where the idea is to utilize
                  known analytical results to the maximum degree. This
                  is possible for systems with a product form
                  probability distribution for which conditional
                  one-dimensional expectations can easily be
                  precomputed. The method is independent of the way
                  the samples are generated. Finally, we study the use
                  of heuristic importance sampling distribution in
                  connection with the traditional Monte Carlo method
                  and the conditional expectation method.},

                  examined in nine normal subjects during four
                  different eye  movement-related conditions: (1)
                  fixation-fixation on a central light emitting diode;
                  (2) saccadic suppression-fixation on a diode in the
                  presence of flashing lateral targets; (3)
                  reflexive/volitional saccades-performance of overt
                  eye movements to two laterally lit targets and back
                  to the centre; and (4) imagined saccades-imagining,
                  but not performing, the same eye movements. The
                  regional neural activity was measured indirectly
                  using repetitive bolus injections of
                  oxygen-15-labelled water and positron emission
                  tomography (PET) to yield time-integrated images of
                  the normalized count distribution. These were
                  aligned and anatomically normalized to a standard
                  stereotactic space and the averages of each
                  condition were analysed categorically using
                  statistical parametric mapping. Compared to central
                  fixation, reflexive/volitional saccades
                  significantly activated regions in the classically
                  known cortical oculomotor regions. The most notable
                  activation during the saccade suppression task,
                  compared to central fixation alone, was a bilateral
                  activation of the parietal cortex with a right-sided
                  preponderance, activation of the supplementary eye
                  field/caudal cingulate regions, and activation of
                  frontal regions close to the frontal eye
                  fields. Imagined performance of eye movements
                  without overt eye movements activated the
                  supplementary eye field and frontal eye fields
                  identically to regions involved in overt eye
                  movements, thus demonstrating that over eye
                  movements are not a prerequisite of the activation
                  of these regions in normal humans. },

  abstract =     {A number of extrastriate visual areas in the
                  parieto-occipital cortex are known from single-cell
                  recordings of the macaque monkey to be involved in
                  the coding of eye-position signals in the
                  brain. These are important for the accurate location
                  of visual objects in extrapersonal space. It can be
                  predicted that these areas will show increased
                  activation during the performance of eye movements
                  at high frequency. In the present study PET and
                  measurements of the regional distribution of
                  cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were used as indirect
                  measures of neural activity. Two independent groups
                  of normal volunteers performed large- amplitude
                  self-generated eye movements in complete darkness,
                  thus removing the confounding effects of visual
                  stimulation on parieto- occipital activation. The
                  first group (group A; n = 5) served as a
                  hypothesis-generating group and the second group
                  (group B; n = 4) served as a hypothesis-testing
                  group. The data were analysed using statistical
                  parametric mapping at a significance level corrected
                  for multiple comparisons (group A, Z > 4.08; group
                  B, Z > 4.04). Significant rCBF increases were found
                  for both groups in the frontal eye fields,
                  supplementary eye fields, cerebellar vermis and
                  putamina/thalami. Additionally, activation was found
                  in the cunei in the posterior bank of the
                  parieto-occipital sulcus. Also, the extraocular
                  muscles were activated and, as a consequence of the
                  partial volume effect, projected to the
                  orbitofrontal cortices. At a less conservative
                  threshold, activation was found close to the
                  intraparietal sulci on the left side (Z = 3.91, P =
                  0.09) and right side (Z = 3.33, P = 0.42). The
                  locations of these areas were  confirmed in group B
                  with reference to high-resolution structural MRI
                  scans. The activation of the parieto-occipital
                  cortex without overt visual stimuli is interpreted
                  as the result of neural activity related to the
                  reception of efferent copies of motor commands
                  and/or the activation of neurons coding for eye
                  position relative to the orbits. These are important
                  constituents for the location and remapping of
                  visual stimuli in space. },

                  researchers access scientific information. Articles
                  are increasingly being made available on the
                  homepages of authors or institutions, at journal Web
                  sites, or in online archives. However, scientific
                  information on the Web is largely disorganized. This
                  article introduces the creation of digital libraries
                  incorporating Autonomous Citation Indexing
                  (ACI). ACI autonomously creates citation indices
                  similar to the Science Citation Index
                  \textregistered\hspace*{0pt}. An ACI system
                  autonomously locates articles, extracts citations,
                  identifies identical citations that occur in
                  different formats, and identifies the context of
                  citations in the body of articles. ACI can organize
                  the literature and provide most of the advantages of
                  traditional citation indices, such as literature
                  search using citation links, and the evaluation of
                  articles based on citation statistics. Furthermore,
                  ACI can provide significant advantages over
                  traditional citation indices. No manual effort is
                  required for indexing, which should result in a
                  reduction in cost and an increase in the
                  availability of citation indices. An ACI system can
                  also provide more comprehensive and up-to-date
                  indices of the literature by indexing articles on
                  the Web, technical reports, conference papers,
                  etc. Furthermore, ACI makes it easy to browse the
                  context of citations to given articles, allowing
                  researchers to quickly and easily see what
                  subsequent researchers have said about a given
                  article. Digital libraries incorporating ACI may
                  significantly improve scientific dissemination and
                  feedback.},

                  anatomically correlated to positron emission
                  tomography (PET) scanning to identify language areas
                  in a patient with an arteriovenous malformation
                  (AVM) in the posterior speech region. The patient
                  was a 24-year-old right-handed woman with an
                  angiographically proven AVM (3-4 cm) in the left
                  mid-posterior second temporal convolution in whom a
                  left intracarotid injection of sodium Amytal
                  produced significant language disruption. A baseline
                  PET cerebral blood flow study identified the AVM,
                  and an activation PET scan performed during the
                  reading and speaking of simple words showed
                  increased activity in the left parastriate cortex
                  (the second visual area), in the left posterior
                  third frontal convolution (Broca's area), and in the
                  left inferior and midtemporal gyri (Wernicke's
                  area). Increased activity was also noted in the
                  right and left transverse temporal (Heschl's) gyri,
                  in the left precentral gyrus, in the left medial
                  superior frontal gyrus (the supplementary motor
                  area), and in the right cerebellum. We conclude that
                  activation PET scanning is useful in the
                  preoperative assessment of patients who harbor
                  cerebral AVMs in classically described speech

                  class of practical and nearly optimal schemes for
                  adapting the size of a neural network. By removing
                  unimportant weights from a network, several
                  improvements can be expected: better generalization,
                  fewer training examples required, and improved speed
                  of learning and/or classification. The basic idea is
                  to use second-derivative information to make a
                  tradeoff between network complexity and training set
                  error. Experiments confirm the usefulness of the

                  themselves curves or functions. The obvious approach
                  breaks down, and it is necessary to use a method
                  involving smoothing in some way. Such a method is
                  introduced and discussed with reference to a data
                  set on human gait. The breakdown of the unsmoothed
                  method is illustrated in a practical context and is
                  demonstrated theoretically. A consistent theorem for
                  the smoothed method is proved.},

                  research comparing the effects of hypermedia and
                  traditional instruction on students'
                  achievement. Thirty-five studies were located from
                  three sources, and their quantitative data were
                  transformed into effect size (ES). The overall grand
                  mean of the study-weighted ES for all 35 studies was
                  0.48. In addition, 3 of the 17 variables selected
                  for this study (instructor bias, type of research
                  design, and type of delivery system) had a
                  statistically significant impact on the mean ES. The
                  results from this study suggest that the effects of
                  using hypermedia in instruction are positive when
                  compared to the effects of traditional
                  instruction. The results of this study also provide
                  classroom teachers with accumulated research-based
                  evidence for positive outcomes of using technology
                  in instruction.}

                  arise in inference with graphical models. After the

  abstract =     {Functional MR (fMR) imaging techniques based on
                  blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) effects
                  were developed and applied to a rat brain tumor
                  model to evaluate the potential utility of the
                  method for characterizing tumor growth and
                  regression following treatment. Rats bearing 9L
                  brain tumors in situ were imaged during inhalation
                  of room air and after administration of 100\% oxygen
                  + acetazolamide (ACZ) injected 15 mg/kg
                  intravenously. Pixel-to-pixel fMR maps of normalized
                  signal intensity change from baseline values were
                  calculated from T2 weighted spin echo (SE) images
                  acquired pre- and post- oxygen + ACZ
                  administration. Resultant fMR maps were then
                  compared to gross histological sections obtained
                  from corresponding anatomical regions. Regions
                  containing viable tumor with increased cellular
                  density and localized foci of necrotic tumor cells
                  consistent with hypoxia were visualized in the fMR
                  images as regions with decreased signal intensities,
                  indicating diminished oxyhemoglobin concentration
                  and blood flow as compared to normal
                  brain. Histological regions having peritumor edema,
                  caused by increased permeability of tumor
                  vasculature, were visualized in the fMR images as
                  areas with markedly increased signal
                  intensities. These results suggest that fMR imaging
                  techniques could be further developed for use as a
                  non-invasive tool to assess changes in tumor
                  oxygenation/hemodynamics, and to evaluate the
                  pharmacologic effect of anti-neoplastic drugs.},

  abstract =     {A cocitation analysis for thirty-six journals and
                  other publications in neural networks research and
                  related disciplines was conducted over three
                  consecutive time periods spanning the years 1990 -
                  early 1997. Cluster analysis and MDS maps identified
                  groupings representing foundation research areas
                  (physics/optics, computer engineering, neuroscience,
                  expert systems gi cognition, and perception) along
                  with neural networks and mathematical modeling of
                  neural systems. Principal components analysis
                  demonstrated a similar structure, with several
                  journals and books loading on a majority of the
                  factors. An INDSCAL analysis showed an increasing
                  separation between natural sciences/psychology and
                  engineering/neural networks research from the first
                  time period to the third.},

                  resonance images of the brain was studied using a
                  denoising method and spectral techniques optimally
                  suited to short time series. It was found that the
                  stimulus related changes have a complex
                  spatiotemporal structure even for simple visual
                  stimuli. Apart from a low frequency window, the non
                  stimulus related changes were found to correspond in
                  detail to either breathing or heartbeat, although
                  these two sources show different patterns of spatial
                  coherence in the image. At low frequencies,
                  oscillations with frequencies around 0.1Hz were
                  observed, also with nontrivial space-time structure
                  which are likely to be vasomotor in origin.},

  abstract =     {OBJECTIVE: Medical informatics is an emergent
                  interdisciplinary field described as drawing upon
                  and contributing to both the health sciences and
                  information sciences. The authors elucidate the
                  disciplinary nature and internal structure of the
                  field. 
                  DESIGN: To better understand the field's
                  disciplinary nature, the authors examine the
                  intercitation relationships of its journal
                  literature. To determine its internal structure,
                  they examined its journal cocitation
                  patterns. 
                  MEASUREMENTS: The authors used data from the Science
                  Citation Index (SCI) and Social Science Citation
                  Index (SSCI) to perform intercitation studies among
                  productive journal titles, and software routines
                  from SPSS to perform multivariate data analyses on
                  cocitation data for proposed core journals. RESULTS:
                  Intercitation network analysis suggests that a core
                  literature exists, one mark of a separate
                  discipline. Multivariate analyses of cocitation data
                  suggest that major focus areas within the field
                  include biomedical engineering, biomedical
                  computing, decision support, and education. The
                  interpretable dimensions of multidimensional scaling
                  maps differed for the SCI and SSCI data sets. Strong
                  links to information science literature were not
                  found. 
                  CONCLUSION: The authors saw indications of a core
                  literature and of several major research fronts. The
                  field appears to be viewed differently by authors
                  writing in journals indexed by SCI from those
                  writing in journals indexed by SSCI, with more
                  emphasis placed on computers and engineering versus
                  decision making by the former and more emphasis on
                  theory versus application (clinical practice) by the
                  latter.},

  abstract =     {The growing availability of databases on the
                  information highways motivates the development of
                  new processing tools able to deal with a
                  heterogeneous and changing information
                  environment. A highly desirable feature of data
                  processing systems handling this type of information
                  is the ability to automatically extract its own key
                  words. In this paper we address the specific problem
                  of creating semantic term associations from a text
                  database. The proposed method uses a hierarchical
                  model made up of Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory
                  (ART) neural networks. First, the system uses
                  several Fuzzy ART modules to cluster isolated words
                  into semantic classes, starting from the database
                  raw text. Next, this knowledge is used together with
                  coocurrence information to extract semantically
                  meaningful term associations. These associations are
                  asymmetric and one-to-many due to the polisemy
                  phenomenon. The strength of the associations between
                  words can be measured numerically. Besides this,
                  they implicitly define a hierarchy between
                  descriptors. The underlying algorithm is appropriate
                  for employment on large databases. The operation of
                  the system is illustrated on several real databases.},

  abstract =     {Probabilistic inference is an attractive approach to
                  uncertain reasoning and empirical learning in
                  artificial intelligence. Computational difficulties
                  arise, however, because probabilistic models with
                  the necessary realism and flexibility lead to
                  complex distributions over high-dimensional spaces.

                  Related problems in other fields have been tackled
                  using Monte Carlo methods based on sampling using
                  Markov chains, providing a rich array of techniques
                  that can be applied to problems in artificial
                  intelligence. The ``Metropolis algorithm'' has been
                  used to solve difficult problems in statistical
                  physics for over forty years, and, in the last few
                  years, the related method of ``Gibbs sampling'' has
                  been applied to problems of statistical
                  inference. Concurrently, an alternative method for
                  solving problems in statistical physics by means of
                  dynamical simulation has been developed as well, and
                  has recently been unified with the Metropolis
                  algorithm to produce the ``hybrid Monte Carlo''
                  method. In computer science, Markov chain sampling
                  is the basis of the heuristic optimization technique
                  of ``simulated annealing'', and has recently been used
                  in randomized algorithms for approximate counting of
                  large sets. 

                  In this review, I outline the role of probabilistic
                  inference in artificial intelligence, present the
                  theory of Markov chains, and describe various Markov
                  chain Monte Carlo algorithms, along with a number of
                  supporting techniques. I try to present a
                  comprehensive picture of the range of methods that
                  have been developed, including techniques from the
                  varied literature that have not yet seen wide
                  application in artificial intelligence, but which
                  appear relevant. As illustrative examples, I use the
                  problems of probabilistic inference in expert
                  systems, discovery of latent classes from data, and
                  Bayesian learning for neural networks.},

                  latent semantic indexing (LSI), although with some
                  variation. Whereas LSI operates by performing a
                  singular value decomposition (SVD) on a large term
                  by document matrix of co-occurence scores, the
                  technique here oprates by identifying eigenvectors
                  and eigenvalues of a term by term matrix of
                  correlation scores (derived from co-occurence
                  scores). The technique of identifying eigenvectors
                  and eigenvalues from a correlation matrix is known
                  as principal component analysis (PCA). Variations
                  from the previous year's TREC work include work
                  using sub-documents (paragraphs), and working with
                  small sub-matrices consisting only of terms in a
                  query, rather than working with all terms from the

  abstract =     {We report that visual stimulation produces an easily
                  detectable (5-20%) transient increase in the
                  intensity of water proton magnetic resonance signals
                  in human primary visual cortex in gradient echo
                  images at 4-T magnetic-field strength. The observed
                  changes predominantly occur in areas containing gray
                  matter and can be used to produce
                  high-spatial-resolution functional brain maps in
                  humans. Reducing the image-acquisition echo time
                  from 40 msec to 8 msec reduces the amplitude of the
                  fractional signal change, suggesting that it is
                  produced by a change in apparent transverse
                  relaxation time T2*. The amplitude, sign, and
                  echo-time dependence of these intrinsic signal
                  changes are consistent with the idea that neural
                  activation increases regional cerebral blood flow
                  and concomitantly increases venous-blood oxygenation.},

                  matter, which depends on the readers interests,
                  knowledge and attitudes. But there is still much
                  that can be said objectively about the relative
                  importance of Web pages. This paper describes
                  PageRank, a mathod for rating Web pages objectively
                  and mechanically, effectively measuring the human
                  interest and attention devoted to them. We compare
                  PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show
                  how to efficiently compute PageRank for large
                  numbers of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank
                  to search and to user navigation.}

                  establishes functional dependencies given a sequence
                  of measurements. The approach is based on
                  calculating conditional probabilities from vector
                  component distances. Imposing the requirement of
                  continuity of the underlying function, the obtained
                  values of the conditional probabilities carry
                  information on the embedding dimension and variable
                  dependencies. The power of the method is illustrated
                  on synthetic time-series with different time-lag
                  dependencies and noise levels and on the sunspot
                  data. The virtue of the method for preprocessing
                  data in the context of feedforward neural networks
                  is demonstrated. Also, its applicability for
                  tracking residual errors in output units is

  abstract =     {For many applications it is useful to sample from a
                  finite set of objects in accordance with some
                  particular distribution. One approach is to run a
                  Markov chain whose stationary distribution is the
                  desired distribution on this set; after the Markov
                  chain has run for {$M$} steps, with {$M$} sufficiently
                  large, the distribution governing the state of the
                  chain approximates the desired
                  distribution. Unfortunately it can be difficult to
                  determine how large {$M$} needs to be. We describe a
                  simple variant of this method that determines on its
                  own when to stop, and that outputs samples in exact
                  accordance with the desired distribution. The method
                  uses couplings, which have also played a role in
                  other sampling-schemes; however, rather than running
                  the coupled chains from the present into the future,
                  one runs from a distant point in the past up until
                  the present, where the distance into the past that
                  one needs to go is determined during the running of
                  the algorithm itself. If the state space has a
                  partial order which is preserved under the moves of
                  the Markov chain, then the coupling becomes
                  particularly efficient. Using our approach one can
                  sample from the Gibbs distributions associated with
                  various statistical mechanics models (including
                  Ising, random-cluster, ice, and dimer) or choose
                  uniformly at random from the elements of a finite
                  distributive lattice.},

                  hemodynamic modulation function (HDMF) of functional
                  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
                  time-series. Unlike previous proposed parametric
                  models, the Gaussian model accounts indepently for
                  the delay and dispersion of the hemodynamic
                  responses and provides a more flexible and
                  mathematically convennient model. A suboptimal
                  noniterative scheme to estimate the hemodynamic
                  parameters is compared with Poisson and Gamma
                  models. The proposed model seems valid because the
                  lag and dispersion values of hemodynamic responses
                  rendered by the Gaussian model are in the ranges of
                  their previously reported values in recent optical
                  and fMR imaging studies.

                  An extension of multiple regression analysis to
                  incorporate the HDMF is presented. The detected
                  activity patterns exhibit improvements with
                  hemodynamic correction. The proposed model and
                  efficient parameter estimation scheme facilitated
                  the investigation of variability of hemodynamic
                  parameters of human brain activation. The
                  hemodynamic parameters estimated over different
                  brain regions and across different stimuli showed
                  significant differences. Measurement of hemodynamic
                  parameters over the brain during sensory or
                  cognitive stimulation may reveal vital information
                  on physiological events accompanying neuronal
                  activation and functional variability of the human
                  brain, and should lead to the investigation of more
                  accurate and complex models.},

  abstract =     {This article reviews common methods for
                  two-dimensional display of registered multimodality
                  brain images and describes a software package for
                  presentation of merged MRI and PET images that runs
                  on a workstation with an eight-bit color
                  display. The software package displays merged brain
                  images from multiple modalities in a way that is
                  readily manipulated, visually pleasing and easy to
                  interpret. The display method used, i.e.,
                  interleaving of alternate pixels with independent
                  color scales, is effective in producing merged
                  images with high contrast-detail for each
                  volume. Interleaving images from different volumes
                  creates unusual perceptual effects, one of which is
                  the apparent camouflage of low-contrast signals by
                  high values in the paired volume. METHODS: The
                  camouflage effect was thought to arise from
                  perceptual merging of adjacent pixels. An observer
                  experiment was conducted to investigate this
                  tendency of high-activity PET data to obscure
                  low-contrast detail in interleaved MRI data in spite
                  of the digital independence of neighboring
                  pixels. Four observers were presented with 20
                  combinations of signal plus background targets with
                  uniform mask images, using a two-alternative
                  forced-choice experimental design with 50 trials per
                  combination. RESULTS: The psychophysical evaluation
                  of the ability of human observers to detect the
                  simple test objects in an interleaved image
                  presentation indicated a statistically significant
                  camouflage effect of one volume on the other for
                  some combinations of target and mask. The concept of
                  perceptual merging of adjacent pixels was able to
                  predict which combinations caused the greatest
                  degradations in performance. CONCLUSIONS: The image
                  interleaving approach to the display of
                  two-dimensional slices from registered image volumes
                  makes efficient use of an eight-bit color
                  display. Contrast resolution of both individual
                  volumes is high compared with that in other
                  techniques and the volumes are presented in familiar
                  color scales. However, the method yields an
                  unexpected camouflage effect that tends to obscure
                  low-contrast signals. The practical effect of such
                  camouflage on the interpretation of clinical images
                  remains to be investigated.},

  abstract =     {Extreme value theory is a branch of statistics that
                  concerns the distribution of data of unusually low
                  or high value, i.e. in the tails of some
                  distribution. These extremal points are important in
                  many applications as they represent the outlying
                  regions of normal events against which we may wish
                  to define abnormal events. In the context of density
                  modelling, novelty detection or radial-basis
                  function systems, points that lie outside of the
                  range of expected extreme values may be flagged as
                  outliers. There has been interest in the area of
                  novelty detection, but decisions as to whether a
                  point is an outlier or not tend to be made on the
                  basis of exceeding some (heuristic) threshold. It is
                  shown that a more principled approach may be taken
                  using extreme value statistics},

  abstract =     {The central nervous pathways of angina pectoris have
                  never been identified in vivo in man. We used
                  positron emission tomography to examine the changes
                  in regional cerebral blood flow associated with
                  angina pectoris. Dynamic positron emission
                  tomography with 15O-labelled water was used in 12
                  patients with angina and angiographically proven
                  coronary artery disease to measure regional cerebral
                  blood flow changes during angina induced by
                  intravenous dobutamine. All subjects had typical
                  retrosternal chest pain accompanied by ischaemic
                  electrocardiographic changes during dobutamine
                  infusion. Compared to the resting state, angina was
                  associated with increased regional cerebral blood
                  flow in the hypothalamus (percentage change in
                  regional cerebral blood flow +6.5 and Z score 7.2)
                  periaquaductal grey (+2.6 and 4.0), bilaterally in
                  the thalamus (left: +2.7 and 4.3; right +3.7 and
                  4.7) and lateral prefrontal cortex (left +11.5 and
                  7.6; right +8.5 and 7.8) and left inferior
                  anterocaudal cingulate cortex (+9.4 and 6.6). In
                  contrast, it was reduced bilaterally in the
                  mid-rostrocaudal cingulate cortex (left -3.7 and
                  6.3; right -4.7 and 4.6) and fusiform gyrus (left
                  -3.2 and 4.0; right -3.3 and 3.7), right posterior
                  cingulate (-3.9 and 5.8) and left parietal cortices
                  (-4.8 and 6.3). Several minutes after stopping
                  dobutamine infusion, when the patients no longer
                  experienced angina and the  lectrocardiographic
                  changes had resolved, thalamic, but not cortical
                  activation could be seen. We propose that the
                  central structures activated constitute the pathways
                  for perception of anginal pain and that the thalamus
                  may act as a  gate to afferent pain signals, with
                  cortical activation being necessary for the
                  sensation of pain. This method of investigation may
                  form a basis for research into anomalies of visceral
                  pain perception such as silent myocardial
                  ischaemia.},

                  all be unified as variations of unsupervised
                  learning under a single basic generative model. This
                  is achieved by collecting together disparate
                  observations and derivations made by many previous
                  authors and introducing a new way of linking
                  discrete and continuous state models using a simple
                  nonlinearity. Through the use of other
                  nonlinearities, we show how independent component
                  analysis is also a variation of the same basic
                  generative model. We show that factor analysis and
                  mixtures of gaussians can be implemented in
                  autoencoder neural networks and learned using
                  squared error plus the same regularization term. We
                  introduce a new model for static data, known as
                  sensible principal component analysis, as well as a
                  novel concept of spatially adaptive observation
                  noise. We also review some of the literature
                  involving global and local mixtures of the basic
                  models and provide pseudocode for inference and
                  learning for all the basic models.},

  abstract =     {The goal of pattern classification can be approached
                  from two points of view: informative --- where the
                  classifier learns the class densities, or
                  discriminative --- where the focus is on learning
                  the class boundaries without regard to the
                  underlying class densities. We review and synthesize
                  the tradeoffs between these two approaches for
                  simple classifiers, and extend the results to modern
                  techniques such as Naive Bayes and Generalized
                  Additive Models. Data mining applications often
                  operate in the domain of high dimensional features
                  where the tradeoffs between informative and
                  discriminative classifiers are especially
                  relevant. Experimental results are provided for
                  simulated and real data.},

  abstract =     {Early neuroimaging studies often failed to obtain
                  evidence of medial temporal lobe (MTL) activation
                  during episodic encoding or retrieval, but a growing
                  number of studies using functional magnetic
                  resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission
                  tomography (PET) have provided such evidence. We
                  review data from fMRI studies that converge on the
                  conclusion that posterior MTL is associated with
                  episodic encoding; too few fMRI studies of retrieval
                  have reported MTL activations to allow firm
                  conclusions about their exact locations. We then
                  turn to a recent meta-analysis of PET studies
                  (Lepage et al., 1998) that appears to contradict the
                  fMRI encoding data. Based on their analysis of the
                  rostrocaudal distribution of activations reported
                  during episodic encoding or retrieval, Lepage et
                  al. (1998) concluded that anterior MTL is strongly
                  associated with episodic encoding, whereas posterior
                  MTL is strongly associated with episodic
                  retrieval. After considering the evidence reviewed
                  by Lepage et al. (1998) along with additional
                  studies, we conclude that PET studies of encoding
                  reveal both anterior and posterior MTL
                  activations. These observations indicate that the
                  contradiction between fMRI and PET studies of
                  encoding was more apparent than real. However, PET
                  studies have reported anterior MTL encoding
                  activations more frequently than have fMRI
                  studies. We consider possible sources of these
                  differences.},

                  Wide Web search engine development, considers the
                  current state of affairs, and reflects on the
                  future. Networked discovery tools have evolved along
                  with Internet resource availability. World Wide Web
                  search engines display some complexity in their
                  variety, content, resource acquisition strategies,
                  and in the array of tools they deploy to assist
                  users. A small but growing body of evaluation
                  literature, much of it not systematic in nature,
                  indicates that performance effectiveness is
                  difficult to assess in this setting. Significant
                  improvements in general-content search engine
                  retrieval and ranking performance may not be
                  possible, and are probably not worth the effort,
                  although search engine providers have introduced
                  some rudimentary attempts at personalization,
                  summarization, and query expansion. The shift to
                  distributed search across multitype database systems
                  could extend general networked discovery and
                  retrieval to include smaller resource collections
                  with rich metadata and navigation tools.},

  abstract =     {The communicative act in a learning organization is
                  subject to a number of threats to its validity
                  (Habermas 1981), in particular the
                  comprehensibility, truth, trustworthiness, and
                  appropriateness of a given message. Organizational
                  Memories can be used to address these threats. Our
                  focus is on email communications which suffers from
                  the same threats identified by Habermas. The
                  integration of email with an Organizational Memory
                  can improve the quality of communication by applying
                  people-centric meta-knowledge to appropriately link
                  a given message to the OM. In this paper we expand
                  upon the direction taken by earlier work of Abecker
                  et al. (1997) with respect to the importance of the
                  object-meta relationship and the use of
                  meta-knowledge to manage (or rather to complete) an
                  OM. We suggest that the focus of the meta-knowledge
                  in an email application, should be on the roles,
                  perspectives, and characteristics of the people in
                  an organization rather than on knowledge
                  description. This, we argue, will effectively insure
                  that knowledge will not be disassociated from the
                  people and the situation (Sierhuis and Clancey
                  1997). We present the HyperMail architecture and
                  sample application to illustrate how formal
                  meta-knowledge is used to re-associate informal
                  email communications to an Organizational Memory.}

  abstract =     {With the use of magnetic resonance it has been
                  possible to make anatomic images without the use of
                  contrast agents. This technique has evovled into
                  functional magnetic resonance imaging, which is used
                  to make functional images of the brain. By using
                  various neural stimulation, such as audio and visual
                  stimulation, activation in specific regions of the
                  brain can be measured. This makes mapping of the
                  brain possible. 

                  The signal that is obtained with magnetic resonance
                  is corrupted with various noise which makes
                  detection of active regions in the brain very
                  difficult. The purpose of this project is to ezamine
                  one of these noise factors, the physiologival
                  confounds.

                  This project focuses on the reduction of
                  physiologic confounds, how it can be modeled and
                  filtered from the data. Also the influence of
                  removal of physiological confounds when finding the
                  voxels that show activation are examined with a
                  number of models.},

                  of term weight assignment in an automatic
                  information retrieval system. In this study, we
                  observe that a normalization scheme that retrieves
                  documents of all lengths with similar chances as
                  their likelihood of relevance will outperform
                  another scheme which retrieves documents with
                  chances very different from their likelihood of
                  relevance. We show that the retrieval probabilities
                  for a particular normalization method deviate
                  systematically from the relevance probabilities
                  across different collections. We present pivoted
                  normalization a technique that can be used to reduce
                  the gap between the relevance and the retrieval
                  probabilities. Training pivoted normalization on one
                  collection, we can successfully use it on other
                  (new) text collections, yielding a robust,
                  collection independent normalization technique. We
                  use the idea of pivoting with the well known cosine
                  normalization scheme. We point out some shortcomings
                  of the cosine normalization function and present two
                  new normalization functions --- pivoted unique
                  normalization and pivoted byte size normalization.},

                  is defined as the frequency with which two documents
                  are cited together. The co-citation frequency of two
                  scientific papers can be determined by comparing
                  lists of citing documents in the Science Citation
                  Index and counting identical entries. Networks of
                  co-cited papers can be generated for specific
                  scientific specialties, and an example is drawn from
                  the literature of particle physics. Co-citation
                  patterns are found to differ significantly from
                  bibliographic coupling patterns, but to agree
                  generally with patterns of direct
                  citation. Clusters of co-cited papers provide a new
                  way to study the specialty structure of
                  science. They may provide a new approach to
                  indexing and to the creation of SDI profiles.}

                  subject motion, but no studies have been done to
                  test this assumption. Time series T*2-weighted
                  volumes were acquired on two clinical 1.5 T MRI
                  systems using spiral and EPI readout gradients from
                  cadavers, a normal volunteer, and nonhomogeneous and
                  homogeneous phantoms. The data were tested for
                  significant differences (P = 0.001) from Gaussian
                  noise in the frequency range 0.0-0.015 Hz. The
                  percentage of voxels that were significant in data
                  from the cadaver, normal volunteer, nonhomogeneous
                  and homogeneous phantoms were 13.7-49.0%,

                  respectively. Low frequency drift was more
                  pronounced in regions with high spatial intensity
                  gradients. Significant drifting was present in data
                  acquired from cadavers and nonhomogeneous phantoms
                  and all pulse sequences tested, implying that
                  scanner instabilities and not motion or

                  1:153-171) is evaluated using stimulated time-course
                  data sets and images acquired during a motor-task
                  activation study. The results indicate that their
                  method for estimating hemodynamic delay parameters
                  is unreliable when the hemodynamic delay time is
                  greater than 1-2 image frames. Problems also arise
                  when system noise is present in addition to
                  physiologic noise. These conditions apply for most
                  task-activation studies with image acquisition rates
                  (TRs) shorter than about 3 sec, and for images
                  acquired at field strengths below 3-4
                  tesla. Modifications are suggested that may make
                  their method usable under these conditions.},

                  from each study. A spline-based warp transformation
                  is applied on the coordinates so new

                  variety of tests are used on the coordinates: 2D

                  analysis with weighted covariance matrix,
                  one-dimension tests, and significance is determined
                  by resampling. It is found that emotion coordinates

                  motor activation task, repetitive finger-to-thumb
                  opposition, we compared the spatial activation
                  patterns produced by (1) global normalization and
                  intersubject averaging of paired-image subtractions,
                  (2) the mean differences of ANCOVA-adjusted voxels
                  in Statistical Parametric Mapping, (3)
                  ANCOVA-adjusted voxels followed by principal
                  component analysis (PCA), (4) ANCOVA-adjustment of
                  mean image volumes (mean over subjects at each time
                  point) followed by F-masking and PCA, and (5) PCA
                  with Scaled Subprofile Model pre- and
                  postprocessing. All data analysis techniques
                  identified large positive focal activations in the
                  contralateral sensorimotor cortex and ipsilateral
                  cerebellar cortex, with varying levels of activation
                  in other parts of the motor system, e.g.,
                  supplementary motor area, thalamus, putamen;
                  techniques 1-4 also produced extensive negative
                  areas. The activation signal of interest constitutes
                  a very small fraction of the total nonrandom signal
                  in the original dataset, and the exact choice of
                  data preprocessing steps together with a particular
                  analysis procedure have a significant impact on the
                  identification and relative levels of activated
                  regions. The challenge for the future is to identify
                  those preprocessing algorithms and data analysis
                  models that reproducibly optimize the identification
                  and quantification of higher-order sensorimotor and
                  cognitive responses.},

  abstract =     {The reproducibility of activation patterns in the
                  whole brain obtained by functional magnetic
                  resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments at 4 Tesla was
                  studied with a simple finger-opposition task. Six
                  subjects performed three runs in one session, and
                  each run was analyzed separately with the t-test as
                  a univariate method and Fisher's linear discriminant
                  analysis as a multivariate method. Detrending with a
                  first- and third-order polynomial as well as
                  logarithmic transformation as preprocessing steps
                  for the t-test were tested for their impact on
                  reproducibility. Reproducibility across the whole
                  brain was studied by using scatter plots of
                  statistical values and calculating the correlation
                  coefficient between pairs of activation maps. In
                  order to compare reproducibility of activated voxels
                  across runs, subjects and models, 2% of all voxels
                  in the brain with the highest statistical values
                  were classified as activated. The analysis of
                  reproducible activated voxels was performed for the
                  whole brain and within regions of interest. We found
                  considerable variability in reproducibility across
                  subjects, regions of interest, and analysis
                  methods. The t-test on the linear detrended data
                  yielded better reproducibility than Fisher's linear
                  discriminant analysis, and therefore seems to be a
                  robust although conservative method. Preliminary
                  data indicate that these modeling results may be
                  reversed by preprocessing to reduce respiratory and
                  cardiac physiological noise effects. The
                  reproducibility of both the position and number of
                  activated voxels in the sensorimotor cortex was
                  highest, while that of the supplementary motor area
                  was much lower, with reproducibility of the
                  cerebellum falling in between the other two
                  areas. },

                  of 8 Hz in human V1, in agreement with previous

                  of flicker stimulation was measured. The hemodynamic
                  response was not observed to be modulated by neural

                  sampling from a posterior distribution. Two
                  important examples are the Gibbs sampler and the
                  Metropolis alogorithm. In addition, several
                  strategies are available for constructing hybrid
                  algorithms. This paper outlines some of the basic
                  methods and strategies, and discusses some related
                  theoretical and practical issues. On the theoretical
                  side, results from the theory of general state space
                  Markov chains can be used to obtain convergence
                  rates, laws of large numbers, and central linit
                  theorems for estimates obtained from Markov chain
                  methods. These theoretical results can be used to
                  guide the construction of more efficient
                  algorithms. For the practical use of Markov chain
                  methods standard simulation methodology provides
                  several variance reduction techniques, and also
                  gives guidance on the choice of sample size and

                  probability distribution given a limited number of
                  expectation values of relevant variables is
                  discussed. There are two key assumptions: that the
                  experiment can be independently repeated a finite
                  number (not necessarily large) of times and that the
                  theoretical expection values of the relevant
                  observables are to be estimated from their measured
                  sample averages. Three independent but complementary
                  routes for deriving the form of the distribution
                  from these two assumptions are reviewed. All three
                  lead to a unique distribution which is identical
                  with the one obtained by the maximum-entropy
                  formalism. The present derivation thus provides an
                  altenative approach to the inference problem which
                  does not invoke Shannon's notion of missing
                  information or entropy. The approach is more limited
                  in scope than the one proposed by Jaynes, but has
                  the advantage that it is objective and that the
                  operational origin of the ``given'' expection values
                  is specified.},

                  described. Electrocorticographic recordings of 1 min
                  duration were recorded from 25 patients who were
                  undergoing resection of tumors in the sensory-motor
                  region or being evaluated for temporal lobectomy for
                  epilepsy. Analysis of the patterns of subdural
                  inter-electrode coherence revealed low coherence
                  across the central sulcus for 11/12 cases where its
                  location could be verified with direct cortical
                  stimulation and/or somatosensory evoked potential
                  mapping. Regions of high coherence identified the
                  location of tumors in the sensory-motor region for
                  10/10 cases. Over the temporal lobe, localized areas
                  of high coherence were evident in 8/9 epilepsy
                  patients, but were not indicative of the location of
                  mesial temporal lobe tumors or inter-ictal spiking,
                  when present. We conclude that analysis of cortical
                  coherence patterns may be helpful for revealing the
                  location of pathologic processes relative to
                  critical cortical areas},

  abstract =     {We have analyzed the geometry, geography, and
                  functional organization of human cerebral cortex
                  using surface reconstructions and cortical flat maps
                  of the left and right hemispheres generated from a
                  digital atlas (the Visible Man). The total surface
                  area of the reconstructed Visible Man neocortex is
                  1570 cm(2) (both hemispheres), similar to 70% of
                  which is buried in sulci. By linking the Visible Man
                  cerebrum to the Talairach stereotaxic coordinate
                  space, the locations of activation foci reported in
                  neuroimaging studies can be readily visualized in
                  relation to the cortical surface. The associated
                  spatial uncertainty was empirically shown to have a
                  radius in three dimensions of similar to 10 mm,
                  Application of this approach to studies of visual
                  cortex reveals the overall patterns of activation
                  associated with different aspects of visual function
                  and the relationship of these patterns to
                  topographically organized visual areas. Our analysis
                  supports a distinction between an anterior region in
                  ventral occipitotemporal cortex that is selectively
                  involved in form processing and a more posterior
                  region (in or near areas VP and V4v) involved in
                  both form and color processing. Foci associated with
                  motion processing are mainly concentrated in a
                  region along the occipito-temporal junction, the
                  ventral portion of which overlaps with foci also
                  implicated in form processing. Comparisons between
                  flat maps of human and macaque monkey cerebral
                  cortex indicate significant differences as well as
                  many similarities in the relative sizes and
                  positions of cortical regions known or suspected to
                  be homologous in the two species.},

  abstract =     {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using
                  blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast
                  has progressed rapidly and is commonly used to study
                  function in many regions of the human brain. This
                  paper introduces a method for characterizing the
                  linear or nonlinear properties of the hemodynamic
                  response. Such characterization is essential for
                  accurate prediction of time-course
                  behavior. Linearity of the BOLD response was
                  examined in the primary visual cortex for
                  manipulations of the stimulus amplitude and
                  duration. Stimuli of 1, 2, 4, and 8 s duration (80%
                  contrast) and 10, 20, 40, and 80% contrast (4 s
                  duration) were used to test the hemodynamic
                  response. Superposition of the obtained responses
                  was performed to determine if the BOLD response is
                  nonlinear. The nonlinear characteristics of the BOLD
                  response were assessed using a Laplacian linear
                  system model cascaded with a broadening
                  function. Discrepancies between the model and the
                  observed response provide an indirect measure of the
                  nonlinearity of the response. The Laplacian linear
                  system remained constant within subjects so the
                  broadening function can be used to absorb
                  nonlinearities in the response. The results show
                  that visual stimulation under 4 s in duration and
                  less than 40% contrast yield strong nonlinear
                  responses.},

                  an empirical experiment for comparing 3D display
                  modes: traditional perspective viewing, anaglyph
                  stereo and shutter glass stereo. We followed two
                  hypotheses 1. shutter glass stereo viewing allows a
                  faster and more accurate recognition than the
                  anaglyph and the perspective viewing, and
                  2. subjects experienced with particular 3D
                  representations are faster and more accurate than
                  subjects without experience. The experiment is based
                  on a true research scenario in organic
                  chemistry. Organic molecules were used as 3D
                  objects. Mean response error and mean response time
                  were calculated for a series of six tasks and 81

                  operations'' needed to change the one string into
                  the other. The edit operations investigated allow
                  changing one symbol of a string into another single
                  symbol, deleting one symbol from a string, or
                  inserting a single symbol into a string. An
                  algorithm is presented which solves this problem in
                  time proportional to the product of the lengths of
                  the two strings. Possible applications are to the
                  problems of automatic spelling correction and
                  determining the longest subsequence of characters
                  common to two strings.},

                  method for within-modality (e.g., PET-to-PET) image
                  alignment. In the present work, they describe
                  modifications to this method that allow for
                  cross-modality registration of MRI and PET brain
                  images obtained from a single subject. To align the
                  images, the algorithm seeks to minimize the standard
                  deviation of the PET pixel values that correspond to
                  each MRI pixel value. The MR images must be edited
                  to exclude nonbrain regions prior to using the
                  algorithm. The method has been validated
                  quantitatively using data from patients with
                  stereotaxic fiducial markers rigidly fixed in the
                  skull. Maximal three-dimensional errors of <3 mm and

                  measured. Computation time on a SPARCstation IPX
                  varies from 3 to 9 min to align MR image sets with
                  (/sup 18/F)fluorodeoxyglucose PET images. The MR
                  alignment with noisy H/sub 2//sup 15/O PET images

                  various sampling, smoothing, and editing strategies
                  were compared. Internal consistency measures were
                  used to place limits on registration accuracy for
                  MRI data, and absolute accuracy was measured using a
                  brain phantom for PET data. All strategies were
                  consistent with subvoxel accuracy for intrasubject,
                  intramodality registration. Estimated accuracy of
                  registration of structural MRI images was in the 75
                  to 150 mu m range. Sparse data sampling strategies
                  reduced registration times to minutes with only
                  modest loss of accuracy. It is concluded that the

                  of image registration problems. Registration
                  strategies can be tailored to meet different needs

                  automated method (AIR 3.0) based on voxel
                  intensity. PET and MRI data from 22 normal subjects
                  were registered to corresponding averaged PET or MRI
                  brain atlases using several specific linear and
                  nonlinear spatial transformation models with an
                  automated algorithm. Validation was based on
                  anatomically defined landmarks. Automated
                  registration produced results that were superior to
                  a manual 9 parameter variant of the Talairach
                  registration method. Increasing the degrees of
                  freedom in the spatial transformation model improved
                  the accuracy of automated intersubject
                  registration. It is concluded that linear or
                  nonlinear automated intersubject registration based
                  on voxel intensities is computationally practical
                  and produces more accurate alignment of homologous
                  landmarks than manual 9 parameter Talairach
                  registration. Nonlinear models provide better
                  registration than linear models but are slower.},

                  brain responses in both PET and fMRI data. The aim
                  is to capture the correlations between the scans of
                  an experiment and a set of external predictor
                  variables that are thought to affect the scans, such
                  as type, intensity, or shape of stimulus
                  response. Its main feature is a Canonical Variates
                  Analysis (CVA) of the estimated effects of the
                  predictors from a multivariate linear model
                  (MLM). The advantage of this over current methods is
                  that temporal correlations can be incorporated into
                  the model, making the MLM method suitable for fMRI
                  as well as PET data. Moreover, tests for the
                  presence of any correlation, and inference about the
                  number of canonical variates needed to capture that
                  correlation, can be based on standard multivariate
                  statistics, rather than simulations. When applied to
                  an fMRI data set previously analyzed by another CVA
                  method, the MLM method reveals a pattern of
                  responses that is closer to that detected in an
                  earlier non-CVA analysis},

  abstract =     {The primary sense modalities (vision, touch and so
                  on) are generally thought of as distinct. However,
                  visual imagery is implicated in the normal tactile
                  perception of some object properties, such as
                  orientation, shape and size. Furthermore, certain
                  tactile tasks, such as discrimination of grating
                  orientation and object recognition, are associated
                  with activity in areas of visual cortex. Here we
                  show that disrupting function of the occipital
                  cortex using focal transcranial magnetic stimulation
                  (TMS) interferes with the tactile discrimination of
                  grating orientation. The specificity of this effect
                  is illustrated by its time course and spatial
                  restriction over the scalp, and by the failure of
                  occipital TMS to affect either detection of an
                  electrical stimulus applied to the fingerpad or
                  tactile discrimination of grating texture. In
                  contrast, TMS over the somatosensory cortex blocked
                  discrimination of grating texture as well as
                  orientation. We also report that, during tactile
                  discrimination of grating orientation, an evoked
                  potential is recorded over posterior scalp regions
                  with a latency corresponding to the peak of the TMS
                  interference effect (about 180 ms). The findings
                  indicate that visual cortex is closely involved in
                  tactile discrimination of orientation. To our
                  knowledge, this is the first demonstration that
                  visual cortical processing is necessary for normal
                  tactile perception.},
